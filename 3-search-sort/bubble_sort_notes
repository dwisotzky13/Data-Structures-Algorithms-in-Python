Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort has time complexity of O(n^2) for worst case and average case because it makes comparisons between two values through the entire array,
needing to make n-1 comparisons per iteration of bubbling. 

(n-1)(n-1) = n^2 - 2n + 1 
Best case time complexity is if array is already sorted, which is O(n) Space complexity is O(1) because it does not make a new copy of the data structure.
